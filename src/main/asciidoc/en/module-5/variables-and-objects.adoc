== 1. The interactive tool we are using to learn the basics of code
//ST: 1. The interactive  we are using to learn the basics of code

//ST: !
It is useful to learn about coding by reading a lesson like this one, but it is more efficient if you can *practice while you read*.

Indeed, a key competency in coding is to learn the simple discipline of writing text carefully:

//ST: !
- not forgetting a `;` at the end of the line
- not forgetting to put a capitalized letter when it is necessary
- learning how to spot opening accolades `{` and closing accolades `}`
- not confusing when to use commas `,` and semi-colons `;`, knowning wen to put double quotes `""` or not...

//ST: !
It is all very trivial, right?

*And yet this is what needs the most practice, at the start.*

//ST: !
So in this lesson, you will see plenty of interactive screens like this one:

[TIP]
====
if you follow this lesson on a pdf, you will not see the interactive screen in your document.

You can open a web browser and do the interactive exercise here:

https://repl.exploreyourdata.com/ui/console.html

or here:

//ST: !
"Interactive screen" means that *you can write directly on it* and see your code in action - yes, right here: click next to "java", a cursor will blink to show that you can write:

//ST: !
Last note before we start: this lesson is on the [underline]#essentials# of coding, so we go fast and discuss just the most important notions of coding.

If you are interested in (much) longer, more thorough approaches, you can have a look at these two interactive courses:

//ST: !
- https://books.trinket.io/thinkjava/index.html["Think Java"] by Tinklet (Java is the same programmming language as the one we use here)
- https://books.trinket.io/pfe/index.html["Python for Everybody"] also by Tinklet (Python is the most popular programming language for data science)

== 2. Variables
//ST: 2. Variables

//ST: !
If we compare coding to cooking, you could say that `variables` are the ingredients of the recipe.

-> variables are a way to create, define and store all the information we need in our mobile app.

What kind of information do we need to store?

//ST: !
- if you create a *gaming app*, you might need to store the name of the player, the score, the energy level, etc...
- if you create an *app selling a service*, you might need to store a login name, a password, a list of products and their prices...

//ST: !
As you see, variables can be of different types: text, numbers, numbers with decimals, ...

//ST: !
[TIP]
====
You can create all the kinds of variables you want, but to help you, a number of them are already predefined because they are so common:
====

//ST: !
==== a. *String* variables: to store text

//ST: !
A variable of type "String" specializes in storing textual information. It is created and defined this way:

//ST: !
[[string]]
.Creating a String variable and giving it a value
[source,java]
----
String playerName; //<1>
playerName = "Bernard B"; //<2>
----

<1> We create the variable (this needs to be *done just once*)

- `String` The capital *S* is mandatory. It means this variable *specializes in storing text*. This is the *type* of the variable and it always *stands in front* of the name of the variable.
- `playerName` this is the name I chose for the variable, it could have been anything else. By convention it always starts *without* a capitalized letter and it has *no space* in it.
- The `;` shows the end of this instruction and *is mandatory* (if you don't put it, the program tries to read the next line as the direct continuation of this one, and it gets confused).

<2> A value is assigned to the variable (this can be done as many times as we need)

- `playerName`: our variable, created just above.
- `=`: the right of the equal sign will be the value of the variable.
- `"Bernard B"`: this is the value I store in the variable `playerName`. *Textual values should be put between quotes " "*.
- The `;` shows the end of this instruction and *is mandatory*.

//ST: !
There is a shortcut if you want to create a variable and give it a value, just in one line of code:

//ST: !
[[string-shortcut]]
.A shortcut
[source,java]
----
String playerName = "Bernard B";
----

*So this single line of code creates a variable called `playerName`, and I immediately give it a value: `Bernard B`.*

//ST: !
This will be handy when we need to show the player's name on the screen of the app: we will just use the variable `player`, and what ever value in it (the player's name) will be shown.

//ST: !
==== b. *Integer* variables: to store round numbers

//ST: !
A variable of type "Integer" specializes in storing round numbers (like 1, 2, 3...). It is created and defined this way:

//ST: !
[[integer]]
.Creating an Integer variable and giving it a value
[source,java]
----
Integer playerAge; //<1>
playerAge = 22; //<2>
----

<1> We create the variable (this needs to be *done just once*)

- `Integer` The capital *I* is mandatory. It means this variable specializes in storing *round numbers*. This is the *type* of the variable.
- `playerAge` this is the name I chose for the variable, it could have been anything else. By convention it always starts *without* a capitalized letter and it has *no space* in it.
- The `;` shows the end of this instruction and *is mandatory* (if you don't put it, the program tries to read the next line as the direct continuation of this one, and it gets confused).

<2> A value is assigned to the variable (this can be done as many times as we need)

- `playerAge` is our variable, created just above.
- `=` the right of the equal sign will be the value of the variable.
- `22` is the value I store in the variable `playerAge`. *Don't use double quote around the value*.
- The `;` shows the end of this instruction and *is mandatory*.

To repeat: __we did not put double quotes around 22! Double quotes `" "` are only for `String` variables! __


//ST: !
There is the same shortcut as usual if you want to create a variable and give it a value, just in one line of code:

//ST: !
[[integer-shortcut]]
.A shortcut
[source,java]
----
Integer playerName = 18;
----

*So this single line of code creates a variable called `playerAge`, and I immediately give it a value: `22`.*

//ST: !
There is another way to use variables for round numbers:

//ST: !
[[int-primitive]]
.Another way
[source,java]
----
int playerName = 18; <1>
----

<1> `Integer` has been replaced by `int`. Both are the same, except that `int` takes *even less space in the memory of your program*.

//ST: !
====
icon:child[3x] Your turn!

1. __Create an Integer variable called `score` and store `999999` in it. __
2. __Create a variable called `purchasedItems`, using `int` instead of `Integer`. Store `4` in it.__
====

//ST: !
<iframe src="https://repl.exploreyourdata.com/ui/console.html" style="width: 500px; height: 150px; border: 0px"></iframe>

//ST: !
Here is the solution:

//ST: !
image::java-repl-3.png[align="center", title="Creating 2 variables to store numbers"]

//ST: !
==== c. *Float*, *Double* and *Long* variables: to store decimal numbers and big numbers

//ST: !
Variables of type "Float" and "Double" specialize in storing decimal numbers (like 1.4533).

The difference between Float and Double? Double can store even more decimals than Float.

Variable of type "Long" specializes in storing loooong numbers (like 9395353439449039035353). It is useful when you need to count milliseconds, for example.

These are created and defined this way:

//ST: !
[[float-double-long]]
.Using Float, Double and Long variables
[source,java]
----
Float averagePrice;
averagePrice = 15.34f; //<1>
Double piValue;
piValue = 3.14159265358979323846d; //<2>
Long timeOfPlayinMilliSeconds;
timeOfPlayinMilliSeconds = 72585335350535l; //<3>
----

<1> We added the letter `f` at the end of our number, to signal that this is a *Float*.
<2> We added the letter `d` at the end of our number, to signal that this is a *Double*.
<3> We added the letter `l` at the end of our number, to signal that this is a *Long*.

//ST: !
There is the same shortcut as usual if you want to create a variable and give it a value, just in one line of code:

//ST: !
[[float-double-long-shortcuts]]
.A shortcut
[source,java]
----
Float averagePrice = 15.34f;
Double piValue = 3.14159265358979323846d;
Long timeOfPlayinMilliSeconds = 72585335350535l;
----

//ST: !
There is another way to use these types of variables, again for a gain in memory:

//ST: !
[[float-double-long-primitive]]
.Another way
[source,java]
----
float averagePrice = 15.34f;
double piValue = 3.14159265358979323846d;
long timeOfPlayinMilliSeconds = 72585335350535l;
----

//ST: !
`Float` is replaced by `float`, `Double` is replaced by `double`, and `Long` is replaced by `long`.

This looks like just a small change, but the smaller cap version takes *even less space in the memory of your program*.

//ST: !
====
icon:child[3x] Your turn!

1. __Create a variable called `discountPercentage` and store `0.33` in it. __
2. __Create a variable called `dollarToEuro`, using `double`. Store `0.80240500000000003` in it.__
3. __Create a variable called `milliseconds`, using `long`. Store `25343353530285753` in it.__

//ST: !
==== d. *Boolean* variables: to store true / false information

//ST: !
If you have never programmed before, this type of variable might be surprising to you.
Why do we need a type of variable that would just store 2 possible values: `true` or `false`?

After all, we could just use a `String` type of variable for that:

//ST: !
[[string-for-boolean]]
.Using a String variable to store a "true" value
[source,java]
----
String customerLoggedIn = "true";
String customerSubscribedToNewsletter= "false";

----

//ST: !
That would work very well, but in practice these true / false values are so common that a special type of variable called `Boolean` has been created just for them:


//ST: !
[[boolean]]
.Using Boolean variables
[source,java]
----
Boolean hasSuperPowers = true;
Boolean isAClubMember = false;
----

Let's notice that *we did not put double quotes around the value `true` or `false`*.

//ST: !
Just like before, there is another way to use these type of variables, again for a gain in memory:

//ST: !
[[boolean-primitive]]
.Another way
[source,java]
----
boolean hasSuperPowers = true;
boolean isAClubMember = false;
----

Notice that `Boolean` has been replaced by `boolean`.

//ST: !
====
icon:child[3x] Your turn!

1. __Create a variable called `isPremiumMember` and store a `true` value in it. __
2. __Create a variable called `isReturningVisitor` and store a `false` value in it__

//ST: !
Here is the solution:

image::java-repl-5.png[align="center", title="Creating 3 variables to store true false values"]

== 3. Objects
//ST: 3. objects

//ST: !
We know how to create and store text, number and true / false values: these ingredients that are the basis of our mobile app.

//ST: !
But we surely need to create a store many thing else... like:

- some Forms, Buttons, Labels!
- a date (April, 10 2010) ?
- colors, pictures, etc.

These type of variables are called `objects`. They are created and defined in the following way. Let's take the example of a Form:
//ST: !

//ST: !
==== a. Creating and defining objects

//ST: !
[[object]]
.Creating and defining a Form
[source,java]
----
Form myForm; // <1>
myForm = new Form(); // <2>
----

//ST: !
<1> We create the object (we `declare` it)

- we define an object called "myForm".
- it specializes in storing Forms. `Form` was put in front of it to indicate this.
- at this stage the variable is empty (the technical term is `null`)

<2> We create and store a value in our object (we `instantiate` the object)

- this line of code creates a new Form and stores it in our variable `myForm`.
- the brackets `()` are empty, but not useless: because in some cases we can add a parameter inside them.
- don't forget the capital `F` to Form, no capital to `new`, don't forget the `()` nor the `;`

//ST: !
Just like for the variables we've seen above, we can take a shortcut: declare and instantiate an object in just one line:

//ST: !
[[object]]
.Declaring and instantiating an object in one line
[source,java]
----
Form myForm = new Form();
----

//ST: !
==== b. Always the same logic: creating Buttons, Labels...

//ST: !
What we saw above is surely intimidating, but if you "get it", then you know how to create a huge variety of things.

(and we have a "cheatsheet" to help you memorize the essentials!)

//ST: !
For our mobile app, you can now create a `Button`:

[[object]]
.Declaring and instantiating a Button
[source,java]
----
Button buttonCookieClicker = new Button();
----

//ST: !
Or a Label:

[[object]]
.Declaring and instantiating a Label
[source,java]
----
Label welcomeMessage = new Label();
----

//ST: !
The `Label` is created in one line of code, but without text in it. That's a bit useless.

Remember when I mentioned that the empty `()` could sometimes include a parameter? `Label` is a good example:


[[object]]
.Declaring and instantiating a Label
[source,java]
----
Label welcomeMessage = new Label("Welcome to my app!");
----

//ST: !
Now, if you read this lesson with care, this alternative could get you a "ahah":

[[object]]
.Declaring and instantiating a String, passing it to a Label
[source,java]
----
String welcomeMessage = "Welcome to my app!";
Label titleOfMyApp = new Label(welcomeMessage);
----

//ST: !
Let's now try to create an object in the interactive screen?

`Form`, `Label` and `Button` are objects provided by the plugin we installed in NetBeans, so they are not included in the interactive console here.

Instead, let's create another object. The object of type `Date` specializes in storing dates:

//ST: !
====
icon:child[3x] Your turn!

1. __Create an object of type "Date" called `dateOfSubscription` and store a new Date in it. __
====

//ST: !
<iframe src="https://repl.exploreyourdata.com/ui/console.html" style="width: 500px; height: 150px; border: 0px"></iframe>


//ST: !
Here is the solution:

image::new-date.jpg[align="center", title="Declaring and instantiating an object of type Date"]

//ST: !
Look at the line in green: it gives the value stored in your variable `dateOfSubscription`: by default, it is the day and time when the variable is instantiated. Very convenient!

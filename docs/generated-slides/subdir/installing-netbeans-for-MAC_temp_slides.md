==  !
- Find the file you downloaded on your computer and click on it to install.

==  !
Note:: you might need administrator rights to install software on your MAC!

==  !
Now that we have NetBeans installed, let’s add the Codename One plugin.

==  2. Adding the plugin "Codename One" to NetBeans

==  !
Open NetBeans. In the menu, select Tools -> Plugins.

In the windows opening, select “Available plugins”.

==  !
Plugins can be listed alphabetically by clicking on the column “name”, that makes them easier to find.

- Search for “Codename One”.
- Select the Codename One plugin by ticking the box on the left.
- Click on “Install” and follow the instructions.

==  3. Restart NetBeans to finish the installation

Congratulations, you are ready to create your first mobile app! 🎉

==  The end
